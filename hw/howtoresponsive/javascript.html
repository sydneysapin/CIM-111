    <p>Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic, is bisected by the Vltava River. Nicknamed “the City of a Hundred Spires,” it's known for its Old Town Square, the heart of its historic core, with colorful baroque buildings, Gothic churches and the medieval Astronomical Clock, which gives an animated hourly show. Completed in 1402, pedestrian Charles Bridge is lined with statues of Catholic saints.

<h2>Food to Eat: The Prague Food Tour of Your Dreams</h2>

<ul>
  <h3>Breakfast</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> <h3>Cafe Savoy</h3>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1466689923919-dbea2d43d41e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1119&q=80" alt="image2">
      <p>Beautifully decorated in the style of a Parisian café with high painted ceilings, Café Savoy is a gem not far from the town center. It is located by the riverside and very close to Petrin Park. It also has a second floor for those who prefer admiring the town from above. Savoy is famous for its breakfasts, which come region-specific.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Lunch</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <h3>Lokal</h3>
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1535958636474-b021ee887b13?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1050&q=80" alt="image3">
          <p>The food scene in Prague has become much more cosmopolitan, but Lokál offers a traditional beer hall experience, with vaulted ceilings and long tables. The menu is typically Czech, which means pork, mounds of sauerkraut and layers of dumplings – accompanied by beer, of course. The quality of the grub here is noticeably higher than that of an average pub.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <h3>Polévkárna Paní Mančo</h3>
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1466978913421-dad2ebd01d17?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=967&q=80" alt="image4">
          <p>Prague’s small but enterprising Georgian community has popularised restaurants specialising in soup, and the name of this popular little joint means ‘soup cafeteria’. Polévkárna Paní Mančo doesn’t have a lunch menu as such, but serves several varieties of soup – Georgian, Czech and international – throughout the day. Look out for the charčo, a thick, filling soup with walnuts. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Dessert</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Cukrarna Mysak</h3>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560643123-9157226100d2?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="image5">
        <p>Mysak had some of the best desserts in Prague. A great place to try some delicious traditional desserts. I loved the vetrnik pastry, which is a choux pastry with vanilla cream, caramel whipped cream and a caramel glaze. Vetrnik is perhaps the best pastry in Prague. A must try is their modern take on kokosový dort, a coconut cake, which was so delicious.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <h3>Good Food Coffee & Bakery</h3>

        <p>Good Food is home to the famous "trdelník" dessert one can find all over Prague. Trdenik pastries are made of rolled yeast dough that is wrapped around a stick and roasted over an open flame until golden brown and crispy on the outside, and tender and gooey in the middle. The hot dough is then brushed with butter and rolled around in a cinnamon-sugar and nut mixture.  You can also get different flavors spread inside such as Nutella or melted chocolate.</p>
