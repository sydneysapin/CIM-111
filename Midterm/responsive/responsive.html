        <h1 class="header"id="About">What is Yoga?</h1>
        <p><em>Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Yoga is a system, not of beliefs, but of techniques and guidance for enriched living. Among Yoga’s many source texts, the two best known are the Yoga Sutras and the Bhagavad Gita. Both explain the nature of—and obstacles to—higher awareness and fulfillment, as well as a variety of methods for attaining those goals.</em></p>

        <h2 class="header">History & Traditional Practices</h2>
        <p>The Indian sage Patanjali is believed to have collated the practice of yoga into the Yoga Sutra an estimated 2,000 years ago. The Sutra is a collection of 195 statements that serves as a philosophical guidebook for most of the yoga that is practiced today. It also outlines eight limbs of yoga: the yamas (restraints), niyamas (observances), asana (postures), pranayama (breathing), pratyahara (withdrawal of senses), dharana (concentration), dhyani (meditation), and samadhi (absorption). As we explore these eight limbs, we begin by refining our behavior in the outer world, and then we focus inwardly until we reach samadhi (liberation, enlightenment).

Today, most people practicing yoga are engaged in the third limb, asana, which is a program of physical postures designed to purify the body and provide the physical strength and stamina required for long periods of meditation.</p>

        <h2 class="header">Vinyasa vs. Hatha</h2>
        <p>Yoga is unquestionably good for you. Increased flexibility, better heart health, even better digestion– all are associated with regular yoga practice.   Yoga helps you burn calories by increasing your heart rate. Hatha yoga burns calories at a lower rate than Vinyasa yoga. Hatha yoga can help you build lean muscle that will boost your metabolism and help you burn fat. Vinyasa yoga can also help you tone up and it burns a lot of calories during each session. Both forms of yoga can help you achieve a healthy, fit body.

Vinyasa yoga can be dangerous if performed recklessly. Many poses require a high level of flexibility and experience in order to do them safely. Starting with Hatha yoga can help you learn the basics and increase your flexibility before starting a more rigorous practice.</p>

      <h1 class="header" id="Benefits">Benefits of Yoga</h1>
      <p>Aside from the physical benefits, one of the best benefits of yoga is how it helps a person manage stress, which is known to have devastating effects on the body and mind. “Stress can reveal itself in many ways, including back or neck pain, sleeping problems, headaches, drug abuse, and an inability to concentrate,” says Dr. Nevins. “Yoga can be very effective in developing coping skills and reaching a more positive outlook on life.”

      <p>Yoga’s incorporation of meditation and breathing can help improve a person’s mental well-being. “Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind; centers attention; and sharpens concentration,” says Dr. Nevins. Body- and self-awareness are particularly beneficial, she adds, “because they can help with early detection of physical problems and allow for early preventive action.”</p>
